Yes, Binary search is possible on the linked list if the list is sorted and we
know the count of elements in list. But While sorting  the list, we can access 
a single element at a time through a pointer to that node i.e. either a previous 
node or next node. This increases the traversal steps per element in linked list 
just to find the middle element. This also makes it slow and inefficient.
