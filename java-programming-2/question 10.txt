Three main applications of graph DS are:

1. Google maps uses graphs for building transportation systems, where intersection
of two(or more) roads are considered to be a vertex and the road connecting two 
vertices is considered to be an edge.

2. In Facebook, users are considered to be the vertices and if they are friends
then there is an edge running between them.

3. In World Wide Web, web pages are considered to be the vertices. There is an edge
from a page u to other page v if there is a link of page v on page u.
