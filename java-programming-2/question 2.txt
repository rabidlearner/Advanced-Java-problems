Following are common DS with their respective applications:

1. Arrays : Implementation of other data structures, Execution of matrices and 
            vectors, Dynamic memory allocation, Pointer container, Control tables.

2. Stack: Evaluation of expressions, Backtracking, Runtime memory management, 
          Arrangement of books in a library.

3. Queue: Here, the data sent need not be received at the same rate at which it
          was sent. A certain system resource is to be shared between different
          processes.

4. Linked-List: Representation of sparse matrices, Non-contiguous data storage, 
                Implementation of non-binary tree or other data structures, 
                Dynamic memory management, Equalizing parenthesis, Symbol tables.

5. Set: Mapping of data, Common data storage.

6. Graph: Computer networking, Problem solutions involving 'Depth-First' search or
          'Breadth-First' search algorithms, Representation of matrices, Study of 
          molecular interactions in Chemistry.

7. Tree: Representation of data lists, Quickly accessible data storage, 
         Representation of hierarchal data, Routing of algorithms.

8. Hash-table: Unique data representation, Implementation of caches, Array 
               association, Locating entries in a table, Representation of objects,
               Database indexing.

9. File: Implementation of computer programs, Data comparison, Storage of data
         having varying data types.
