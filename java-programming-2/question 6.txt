Difference between a stack and an array:

Stack is a linear data structure in which insertion and deletion will take place
at the top position alone. It follows LIFO order i.e. last in first out. The 
element in the top most position alone can be retrieved.

Array is also a linear data structure in which insertion and deletion can take place
at any position. The elements can be retrieved randomly (i.e. at any positional
order) in arrays.
