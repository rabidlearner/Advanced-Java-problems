Binary search tree is a special tree specifically used for searching. 
It is a binary tree where the left child contains only nodes with values less
than the parent node, and where the right child only contains nodes with values
greater than or equal to the parent. Hence the search operation in a BST is 
far less expensive than a binary tree.
